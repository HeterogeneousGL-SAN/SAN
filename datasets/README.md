Inside this folder place the MES and PubMed datasets downloaded from Figshare.

Follow these steps to setup data correctly. Please note that folders names have not a specific meaning or relation with the actual files stored:

- inside MES and pubmed create a folder called `split_transductive/train`
- place the content of MES and pubmed (the csv files, and the `processed` folder) inside `datasets/mes/split_transductive/train` and `datasets/pubmed/split_transductive/train`
